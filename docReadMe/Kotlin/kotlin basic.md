## var
`var` keyword is used to define mutable variable. It means when we need to change variable value after initialization. 

**syntax:** `var variableName: Type`

```
var name: String = "Neeraj"
name = "kumar"
var age: Int
```

## val
`val` keyword is used to define read-only / immutable variable, means variable value can't change after initialization.

**syntax:** `val variableName: Type`

```
val name: String = "Neeraj"
name = "kumar" // we will get syntax issue in this line
```
## null safety


## late init
